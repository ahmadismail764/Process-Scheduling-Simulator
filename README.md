# CPU Schedulers Simulator

This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms as part of **CS341 – Operating Systems 1** at **Cairo University, Faculty of Computers & Artificial Intelligence**.

## Overview

CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems, determining which processes run when multiple processes are eligible. This simulator implements the following schedulers:

- **Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling** (with context switching)
- **Non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)** (with starvation prevention)
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** (with starvation prevention)
- **FCAI Scheduling**: An adaptive algorithm combining priority, arrival time, and remaining burst time.

## FCAI Scheduling

### Key Components

- **Dynamic FCAI Factor**:

  - Combines **Priority (P)**, **Arrival Time (AT)**, and **Remaining Burst Time (RBT)**:
    \[
    \text{FCAI Factor} = (10 - P) + \frac{\text{AT}}{V_1} + \frac{\text{RBT}}{V_2}
    \]
    Where:
    - \( V_1 = \frac{\text{Last Arrival Time of All Processes}}{10} \)
    - \( V_2 = \frac{\text{Max Burst Time of All Processes}}{10} \)

- **Quantum Allocation Rules**:

  - Initial quantum is unique to each process.
  - Quantum updates dynamically based on execution:
    - \( Q = Q + 2 \) if a process uses its quantum completely but has remaining work.
    - \( Q = Q + \text{unused quantum} \) if preempted.

- **Execution**:
  - Non-preemptive for the first 40% of quantum.
  - Allows preemption afterward.

## Example of FCAI Scheduling

### Input Processes

| Process | Burst Time | Arrival Time | Priority | Initial Quantum |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 17         | 0            | 4        | 4               |
| P2      | 6          | 3            | 9        | 3               |
| P3      | 10         | 4            | 3        | 5               |
| P4      | 4          | 29           | 8        | 2               |

### Execution Timeline

| Time Interval | Process | Action                             |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0–3           | P1      | Executes for 3 units, burst=14.    |
| 3–6           | P2      | Preempts P1, executes for 3 units. |
| ...           | ...     | (More detailed execution steps)    |
